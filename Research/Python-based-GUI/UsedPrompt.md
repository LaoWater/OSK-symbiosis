# PyQt/PySide On-Screen Keyboard Prompt

I would like to see a medium example script and GUI implementation in PyQt/PySide (Qt for Python) that is feature-rich and delivers a visually appealing experience.

## Overview

Develop an on-screen keyboard (OSK) with the following core features:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  - Displays a keyboard where each key is clickable.
  - Clicking a key sends the corresponding mechanical input to the PC.

- **Theme & Style:**
  - **Dark Theme:** The overall look should be dark.
  - **Neon Blue Accents:** Use subtle neon blue layouts along the edges and keys.
  - **Hover Effects:** Implement beautiful hover effects and other visual enhancements for an immersive user experience.

- **Window Behavior:**
  - The OSK window must always remain on top of other applications until minimized.
  - When interacting with any typing field (or even if no field is focused), clicking a key on the OSK should simulate 
  - mechanical key pressings in the last active window (or default to "Explorer" if no window is active).

## Current Challenge

There is a critical flaw to address:
- **Focus Issue:** When clicking a key, the main window incorrectly shifts focus to the keyboard itself. 
- This prevents the intended key press from being sent to the last active window. 
- The goal is to ensure that key inputs are directed to the previously active window.

## Development Considerations

1. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Break down the logic and user experience.
   - Consider the real-world use of an on-screen keyboard.
   - Evaluate the flow of signals and inputs to maintain the correct window focus.

2. **User Experience (UX):**
   - Ensure that the UI remains beautiful, intuitive, and functional.
   - Provide subtle animations and feedback to enhance interaction without distracting the user.

3. **System Integration:**
   - The OSK should work seamlessly with other applications.
   - Key events must be simulated in the background without causing focus disruption.
