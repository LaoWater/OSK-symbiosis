# OSK-symbiosis
AI assistant to greatly reduce mechanical force needed when operating PC: Keyboard, Voice, Custom Next-Word-Prediction and more.

# OSK-symbiosis

## Overview

Groundbreaking project designed to radically reduce the mechanical force required to interact with your PC. By integrating advanced AI capabilities, this assistant reimagines computer input by combining multiple state-of-the-art features into a seamless user experience. Whether you're using an on-screen keyboard, voice commands, or next-word prediction, the assistant adapts to your needs to enhance productivity and accessibility.

## Key Features

- **Auto-Keyboard:**  
  An intelligent on-screen keyboard that stays always on top without disrupting your workflow. It simulates mechanical keystrokes by sending input directly to the last active window, allowing you to type effortlesslyâ€”even when switching between applications.

- **Voice Control:**  
  Harness the power of natural language processing to control your PC with voice commands. This feature not only reduces physical strain but also offers an accessible hands-free alternative for everyday tasks.

- **Custom Next-Word Prediction:**  
  Leveraging advanced AI algorithms, the assistant predicts your next word as you type, streamlining your input process and reducing the number of keystrokes needed. The system learns and adapts to your unique vocabulary and usage patterns.

- **Enhanced Accessibility & Reduced Mechanical Strain:**  
  Designed with ergonomics in mind, the Neo AI Input Assistant minimizes the physical effort traditionally required for typing and command execution, making computer interaction smoother and more efficient for all users.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **GUI Framework:** PySide6 (Qt for Python)  
- **Voice Recognition:** Integration with libraries such as SpeechRecognition (or similar) for real-time voice command processing  
- **Keyboard Simulation:** The `keyboard` library for global keystroke simulation on Windows  
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Custom models and algorithms for next-word prediction and adaptive user interface enhancements
